## ABOUT ME
Hi,
I'm Delight Amadi, a Sales and Business Intelligence Analyst and Data Entry Specialist.

I watched my business crumble to zero, not because of hard work, but because I  lacked the right business insights to sustain and grow it. That turning point pushed me to transition from Biochemistry to tech and mastered data analysis without a coding background.
